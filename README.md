# Pop.MomentumDash
I wanted to learn how to Northstar mod (again) so I made this, implementing this [mod idea](https://discord.com/channels/920776187884732556/922663696273125387/1175909582908952607)  
![i want to make a mod thats pretty much a utility like the grapple and stim but i litteraly cant (also replaces melee anims with sword anims)
p much it deals some damage where the util is started, teleports the player forwards a little and then goes on cool down
while conserving the momentum they had when they started the util
damage would be low
so its not op
and it would be omni directional
so you would teleport in the direction you are facing
it would be really hard to do though
and i litteraly dont know how
so mabye one day ðŸ« ](/markdown_resources/idea.png)
